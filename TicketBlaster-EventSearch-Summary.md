# TicketBlaster Event Search and Discovery - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully created a comprehensive Event Search and Discovery functionality for the TicketBlaster ticketing platform. This system provides powerful tools for users to find, explore, and discover events.

## What Was Built

### 1. Core Models (`TicketBlaster.Shared/Models/`)
- **SearchModels.cs**: Complete set of models for search requests, responses, facets, and discovery features
- Event search request/response models with pagination
- Discovery sections for curated content
- Trending and recommendation models
- Analytics response models

### 2. Search Service (`TicketBlaster.Server/Services/EventSearchService.cs`)
- Advanced full-text search across title, description, location, and tags
- Multi-faceted filtering:
  - Categories (single or multiple)
  - Date ranges
  - Price ranges
  - Location (text or geolocation-based)
  - Virtual/in-person events
  - Tags
- Sorting options (9 different sort criteria)
- Faceted search results with counts for refinement
- Performance optimization with result caching
- Search term tracking for analytics

### 3. Discovery Service (`TicketBlaster.Server/Services/EventDiscoveryService.cs`)
- Personalized discovery content with multiple sections:
  - Featured Events
  - Trending Events (with configurable time periods)
  - Events Near You (location-based)
  - This Week's Events
  - Virtual Events
  - Free Events
  - Personalized Recommendations
  - Newly Added Events
  - Last Chance (limited availability)
- Recommendation engine based on:
  - User's past event attendance
  - Preferred categories
  - Event tags
  - Popularity metrics
- Similar events algorithm
- Event view and interaction tracking
- Statistics and analytics

### 4. API Controllers
- **EventSearchController**: 9 specialized search endpoints
- **EventDiscoveryController**: 8 discovery and analytics endpoints
- **EventController**: Basic CRUD operations with event lifecycle management

### 5. Supporting Services (Stubs)
- EventService (implemented with full CRUD operations)
- TicketService, OrderService, PaymentService, UserService, EmailService, KeycloakService (basic stubs)

## Key Features

### Search Capabilities
- **Full-text search** with relevance scoring
- **Location-based search** with radius filtering
- **Advanced filtering** with multiple criteria
- **Faceted navigation** for search refinement
- **Multiple sort options** including relevance and distance
- **Pagination** for all list endpoints

### Discovery Features
- **Trending algorithm** based on recent activity, popularity, urgency, and featured status
- **Personalized recommendations** using collaborative filtering
- **Similar events** based on multiple similarity factors
- **Curated content sections** for different user needs
- **Real-time tracking** of views and interactions

### Performance & Scalability
- Result caching for trending events (15-minute cache)
- Efficient database queries with eager loading
- Pagination to limit result sets
- Indexed fields for search performance

### Security
- Authentication required for personalized features
- Authorization policies for event management
- Event ownership verification

## API Endpoints Summary

### Search Endpoints (9 total)

- `GET /api/eventsearch/by-price` - Price range search
- `GET /api/eventsearch/virtual` - Virtual events
- `GET /api/eventsearch/free` - Free events
- `POST /api/eventsearch/facets` - Get search facets
- `GET /api/eventsearch/popular-terms` - Popular search terms

### Discovery Endpoints (8 total)
- `GET /api/eventdiscovery` - Main discovery content
- `GET /api/eventdiscovery/trending` - Trending events
- `GET /api/eventdiscovery/recommended` - Personalized recommendations
- `GET /api/eventdiscovery/similar/{id}` - Similar events
- `GET /api/eventdiscovery/featured` - Featured events
- `GET /api/eventdiscovery/this-week` - This week's events
- `POST /api/eventdiscovery/view/{id}` - Record event view
- `POST /api/eventdiscovery/interact/{id}` - Record interaction

### Event Management Endpoints (9 total)

## Documentation Provided

1. **README-EventSearch.md**: Comprehensive documentation of the entire system
2. **test-search-api.http**: 30 example API requests for testing
3. **This summary document**: High-level overview of the implementation

## Technologies Used

- ASP.NET Core Web API
- Entity Framework Core
- Memory Caching
- Dependency Injection
- RESTful API design

## Future Enhancements

The system is designed to be extended with:
- Elasticsearch integration for more powerful search
- Machine learning for better recommendations
- Real-time updates via SignalR
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Social features
- A/B testing capabilities

## Integration Points

The system integrates with:
- Oqtane framework (base models and services)
- Entity Framework for data access
- ASP.NET Core authentication/authorization
- Memory caching for performance

This implementation provides a solid foundation for event search and discovery that can scale with the platform's growth while providing an excellent user experience for finding and exploring events.
