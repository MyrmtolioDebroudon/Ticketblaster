The ticketing industry is ready for disruption. High fees, poor service, and vendor lock-in have created massive dissatisfaction among event organizers. TicketBlaster's open-source approach, combined with enterprise features and community support, positions us perfectly to capture significant market share.

Our competitive advantages are structural - competitors cannot match our pricing without destroying their business models, and they cannot offer true data ownership without fundamental changes to their platforms.

The path to victory is clear: focus on cost-conscious organizers who value control, build an unstoppable community, and let our customers become our best salespeople through the success they achieve.
